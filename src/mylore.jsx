            Hey there , fellow tech enthusiast. Iâ€™m Ithiel a front-end software engineer (for now) ðŸ˜‚ , with a Major in Computer Science . I have built a number of projects that have been showcased in this portfolio but those arenâ€™t the full extent of my abilities I assure you. I am always willing and accustomed to learn new things and pickup and adopt new frameworks and libraries out of curiosity or as the Job or task requires ðŸŒš . I hope to share my ideas and creations with the world one day and I hope you get to experience the enthusiasm this industry brings me . I am currently expanding my knowledge in backend development to broaden my expertise in fullstack development with active plans to delve into another field of development on completion of that.

                          Embarked on a six month internship training with the aim of familiarizing myself with the Tech Industry and gaining the skills necessary to make a career in this industry..
                          During this six month period I built a car dealership site , a site for a  travel agency  and the first of many iterations of  my portfolio site among other projects.

                          I developed a fully functional , fully responsive Website that illustrates the different services offered by this business.
                          I also worked side by side with the client answering questions and recommending different services that helped to ensure easier facilitation of the hosting of the Website.

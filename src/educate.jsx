                          I was able to achieve a childhood dream of Studying and Graduating with a degree in Computer Science , a course that believe it or not i've had a desire to study since my early primary education. I was fascinated by technology and knew from then that this was a field i could see myself in. While in school i was able to publish a paper on a topic of interest in the IJSRED Journal, work on some fun projects.
